Enables 3D Secure card payments and refunds in WooCommerce via Braintree - a Level 1 PCI DSS compliant payment gateway

== Description ==

[Woo Braintree Payment](http://mynixworld.info/shop/product/woo-mynix-braintree) is a plug-in that enables [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce) merchants to accept debit/credit card and/or PayPal payments via the [Braintree](http://braintreepayments.com) - a PayPal company. [Braintree is a Level 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree_%28company%29) [PCI-DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) compliant service provider.

Our plug-in extends the WooCommerce by defining a new (card) payment method called Braintree. As such the WooCommerce checkout page offers a new payment method - Credit card - with three fields: a card number, card expiry date and the Card Code Verification (aka CCV or CVC).

The plug-in is built with [PCI DSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) in mind. The card information is exchanged exclusively between the card holder and the Braintree gateway - a Level 1 PCI DSS service provider. This is very important if you want your webshop [to be Level 3 PCI-DSS compliant](https://www.braintreepayments.com/faq#pci-compliance) (and you, as a merchant, [should be](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/why_comply.php)!). 

The plug-in allows various levels of card customization, from its aspect (via custom CSS) to functionality. Nevertheless it allows you to configure it and train its functionalities in a Sandbox environment and finally, when you are ready, just switch it to production mode with one click. See a comparision between [Sandbox mode and Production mode](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/get-started/try-it-out#sandbox-vs.-production).

= Woo Braintree Payment - PRO version =

This plug-in comes in two different flavors:

* Woo Braintree Payment - the free edition of this plug-in hosted at WordPress.org. This edition should be just fine for the average merchant.
* [Woo Braintree Payment - PRO](http://mynixworld.info/shop/product/woo-mynix-braintree-pro) - the premium edition which is hosted by [ourselves](http://mynixworld.info/shop/). It is oriented towards those merchants who need a more robust and customizable WooCommerce credit card payment plug-in. For a comparison between the two editions please see a [features comparison matrix](http://mynixworld.info/shop/woo-mynix-braintree-comparison/).

= How it works =

1. First you need to [sign up for a Braintree account](https://www.braintreepayments.com/signup). You will get an unique [merchant ID](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials) which is linked to a single bank account/currency. You may setup your Braintree account such that [you may have different bank accounts corresponding to different currencies](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/get-started/currencies).
2. When the customer places a shopping order the plug-in will send on your behalf a request to the Braintree Payment Gateway to authorize the sale transaction. By doing that the Braintree will charge your customer the amount specified by the customer order's total amount.
3. If the transaction is authorized (ie. the card is valid and has enough funds for the transaction) then in order to collect the founds the transaction is going to be settled. After a transaction is settled, funds will pass through your merchant account to your bank account.
